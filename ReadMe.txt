---- History ----

This was one of my first projects I ever did with any programming language and it's the only project I have left from programming with C. 
The code design is terrible but at this time I only knew some really basic stuff about programming in C.
I never thought about commenting the code, so to understand the code I'd have to look an eternity at it to understand it.
